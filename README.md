The plugin will measure online times as soon as it is added to the server

- Great for seeing player activity and finding the most active players on the server!

# Commands:
- /ot total [player]  (Get the total online time of yourself or another player)
- /ot session [player] (Get the current session duration of yourself or another player)
- /ot top [page] (Get the list of top most active players_
- /ot info (Displays version and credits)

# TODO

- Add a rewards system for top most active players (after a while)
